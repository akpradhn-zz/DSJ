## Day 13 : Exploring MLOps Tutorial 

Today, I explored Continuous Machine Learning (CML). It helped to automate deployemnt workflow like training, evaluation and monitoring etcs.
For this, I have taken reference from https://github.com/andronovhopf/wine to build and test the complete workflow. 

I have explored 
    - Buit a random model classification model to predict wne quality
    - Generate images from the code
    - Build a CML workflow to run the code and generate a report which can be added to the PR.
