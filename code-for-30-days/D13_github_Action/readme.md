## Day 13 : Exploring MLOps Tutorial 

Today, I explored Continuous Machine Learning (CML). It helped to automate deployemnt workflow like training, evaluation and monitoring etcs.
For this, I have taken reference from [wine](https://github.com/andronovhopf/wine) to build and test the complete workflow. 

I have explored 
   * Buit a random model classification model to predict wne quality
   * Generate images from the code
   * Build a CML workflow to run the code and generate a report which can be added to the PR.

Code Details Can be found here [wine-quality-mlops](https://github.com/akpradhn/wine-quality-mlops)
