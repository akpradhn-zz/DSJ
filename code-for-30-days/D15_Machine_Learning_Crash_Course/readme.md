#### Basics of Machine Learning 
- https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro
- Label, Feature, unlabeled, model 
- Regression Vs Classification 
- Loss Function 
    - Also Called squared error calculated as (observation - predicted)^2 i.e. (y-y')^2
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) = (1/N) * sum[(observation - predicted)^2] 
- Reducing Loss : 
    
    Discover how to train a model using an iterative approach. Understand full gradient descent and some variants, including:
    - mini-batch gradient descent
    - stochastic gradient descent
    - Experiment with learning rate.
    - Convex Vs Non-Convex Functions
    
- Learning Rate : he ideal learning rate in one-dimension is  (the inverse of the second derivative of f(x) at x).
